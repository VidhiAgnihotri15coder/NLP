    "1) Heuristic methods: not optimal but practical, rule based approach. Let us see some examples of using this\n",
    "-->Regular expressions\n",
    "-->Wordnet: lexical dictionary\n",
    "-->Open Mind Common Sense\n",
    "Advantages: quick\n",
    "2) Machine Learning Approach\n",
    "Big advantage yeh hai ki yahan algorithms hoti hai jiske rules data ko dekhkr bnate hain. Textual data ko number mein convert krte hain, fir number ko ML algo mein dekr output dekhte hain\n",
    "-Algorithm used: Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, SVM, LDA, Hidden Markov Models\n",
    "3) Deep Learning Approach\n",
    "Big advantage yeh h ki ML algorithm jo hoti hain usmein algorihtm mein jb textual data ko numbers mein convert krte hain toh sequential information lose ho jaati hai kyuki voh usspr dhyaan nhi deti, but DL mein aisa nahi hai. Dusri yeh cheez hai ki feature generation DL khud krdeta hai.\n",
    "Architecture used: RNN, LSTM, GRU/CNN, Transformers, Autoencoders\n",
